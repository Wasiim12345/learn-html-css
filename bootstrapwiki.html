   <p><b>Bootstrap</b> is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web
      development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript -based design templates for typography, forms, buttons,
      Navigation, and other interface components.
   </p>
   <p>As of August 2021, Bootstrap is the tenth most starred project on <b>GitHub</b>, with over 152,000 stars, behind
      freeCodeCamp (over 328,000 stars), Vue.js framework, React library, and others.

   <p>Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a
      framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for
      interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer
      Mark Otto:
   </p>
   <style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r996844942">
      .mw-parser-output .templatequote {
         overflow: hidden;
         margin: 1em 0;
         padding: 0 40px
      }

      .mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite {
         line-height: 1.5em;
         text-align: left;
         padding-left: 1.6em;
         margin-top: 0
      }
   </style>
   <blockquote class="templatequote">
      <p>A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an
         opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial
         than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document
         and share common design patterns and assets within the company.
      <p>After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the
         project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from
         Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011. It has continued to
         be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community
         of contributors.
      </p>
      <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bootstrap_2">Bootstrap 2</span></h3>
      <p>On January 31, 2012, Bootstrap 2 was released, which added built-in support for Glyphicons, several new
         components, as well as changes to many of the existing components. This version supports responsive web design,
         meaning the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account the characteristics of the device used
         (whether desktop, tablet, or mobile phone).
      </p>
      <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bootstrap_3">Bootstrap 3</span></h3>
      <p>On August 19, 2013, Bootstrap 3, was released. It redesigned components to use flat design and a mobile first
         approach. Bootstrap 3 features new plugin system with namespaced events. Bootstrap 3 dropped Internet Explorer
         7 and Firefox 3.6 support, but there is an optional polyfil for these browsers.
      </p>
      <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bootstrap_4">Bootstrap 4</span></h3>
      <p>Mark Otto announced Bootstrap 4 on October 29, 2014. The first alpha version of Bootstrap 4 was released on
         August 19, 2015. The first beta version was released on August 10, 2017. Mark suspended work on Bootstrap 3 on
         September 6, 2016, to free up time to work on Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap 4 was finalized on January 18, 2018.

      <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Features">Features</span></h2>
      <p>Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as
         opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of
         color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge
         find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all
         HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In
         addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance
         of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings,
         more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.
      </p>
      <p>Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components in the form of jQuery plugins. They provide additional
         user interface elements such as boxes, tooltips, and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML
         structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the functionality
         of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields.
      </p>
      <p>The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web page. The
         basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. Developers
         can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container. While the latter always fills the width
         of the web page, the former uses one of the five predefined fixed widths, depending on the size of the screen
         showing the page:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Smaller than 576 pixels</li>
         <li>576–768 pixels</li>
         <li>768–992 pixels</li>
         <li>992–1200 pixels</li>
         <li>Larger than 1200 pixels</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once a container is in place, other Bootstrap layout components implement a CSS Flexbox layout through defining
         rows and columns.
      </p>
      <p>A precompiled version of Bootstrap is available in the form of one CSS file and three JavaScript files that can
         be readily added to any project. The raw form of Bootstrap, however, enables developers to implement further
         customization and size optimizations. This raw form is modular, meaning that the developer can remove unneeded
         components, apply a theme and modify the uncompiled Sass files.
